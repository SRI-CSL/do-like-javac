do-like-javac
=============

`do-like-javac` (or dljc for short) is a tool for monitoring the build process of
a Java project and recording information about what parameters were passed to `javac`
for the purpose of later analysis. It can also automate the running of various
analysis tools, including:

* [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/)
* [Bixie](http://sri-csl.github.io/bixie/)
* [Checker Framework](http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/)

`do-like-javac` supports projects built with:

* Apache Ant
* Apache Maven
* Gradle
* Manual invocation of `javac`

If you have a project that builds through Eclipse that you want to analyze,
Eclipse can generate an Ant-compatible `build.xml` file by right-clicking the
project, selecting "Export" and choosing the "Ant Buildfiles" option.

Dependencies
============

* Python 3

That's it. No other external dependencies for the core `do-like-javac` scripts.

Of course, you will also need to have installed:

* The analysis tool(s) you want to run.
* Any build dependencies of the project you're analyzing.

`do-like-javac` was built and tested on Mac OS X and GNU/Linux. It probably also
works on Microsoft Windows, but the method of invocation is probably different and
we provide no support.

Installation
============

    git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/do-like-javac.git

Then symlink the `dljc` executable to somewhere in your $PATH, e.g.

    ln -s /path/to/dljc $HOME/bin/dljc

Running
=======

First, make sure your project is in a clean state (e.g. via `ant clean`,
`mvn clean`, etc.). Since `do-like-javac` monitors the build process and build
tools skip already-built files, if you run `dljc` on an already-built project,
you won't get any results.

Next, invoke `dljc` from the directory of the project you want to analyze:

    dljc -o logs -- ant build

Where "ant build" is replaced by whatever command builds your project. Output
will be emitted to logs/toplevel.log

You may also run one or more checking tools on the discovered java files, by
invoking with the -t option and a comma separated list of tools to use (e.g.
"-t print", "-t randoop" or "-t print,randoop").

If you're running checking tools, there are a couple more flags that may be
helpful. `--quiet` suppresses output from tools, and `--timeout <seconds>`
kills any tool subcommand that runs longer than `<seconds>`.

Caching
=======

`do-like-javac` can only extract data from a full compile of a project. That means
if you want to re-run it with new arguments or different analysis tools, you will
have to clean and fully re-compile your project. To save time and shortcut this
process, we save a cache of the results in the output directory. If you want `dljc`
to use this cache, simply add the `--cache` flag and the cache (if available) will
be used instead of recompiling your project.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We don't do any sort of cache invalidation or freshness checking.
If you add new files to your project and want `dljc` to pick up on them, you will have
to do a full clean and run `dljc` without the `--cache` flag.

Supported Tools
===============

Print
-----

The print tool (`dljc -t print`) will pretty-print the detected `javac` commands, as well as any generated JAR files, and their entry points if applicable.

Bixie
-----

The Bixie tool will run your project through [Bixie](http://sri-csl.github.io/bixie/). You will need to provide a library directory containing bixie.jar using the `--lib` option.

    dljc --lib path/to/libs/ -t bixie -- mvn compile

Dyntrace
---------

The Dyntrace tool will run your project through Randoop to generate tests, then run those tests with Daikon/Chicory to generate invariants. You will need to provide a library directory with the following jars using the `--lib` option:

* randoop.jar
* junit-4.12.jar
* hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

You will also need Daikon built and installed somewhere, with the environment variable `DAIKONDIR` pointing to your installation.

    dljc --lib path/to/libs/ -t dyntrace -- mvn compile

Checker Framework whole-program inference
---------

The Checker Framework's whole-program inference tool will iteratively type-check your
program using the specified Checker Framework checker until the set of annotations reaches
a fix-point (note that this process may not terminate). You will need the Checker Framework's
`checker.jar` file. An example of invoking this tool might look like this:

    dljc --lib path/to/checker.jar -t wpi --checker org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker -- ./gradlew compileJava

The `--checker` option is usually required. Its argument is the name(s) of the checker you want to run, separated by commas
(identically to the standard syntax used by the -processor argument to javac). If no `--checker` argument is supplied,
then the classpath will be searched for annotation processors using javac's standard annotation processor discovery
mechanism; from the javac documentation:
> The search path can be specified with the -processorpath option. If no path is specified, then the user
> class path is used. Processors are located by means of service provider-configuration files named
> `META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor` on the search path. Such files should
> contain the names of any annotation processors to be used, listed one per line.

This tool also supports some other tool-specific optional arguments:
* `--stubs /path/to/stubs` tells the checker to run with the specified stub files.
* `--jdkVersion 8/11` tells the Checker Framework to run using JDK8 or JDK11.
* `--quals /path/to/qual.jar` tells the Checker Framework where to find qualifiers (annotations) to put on the classpath.
* `--extraJavacArgs='-AcustomArg1 -AcustomArg2'` passes the given arguments to invocations of `javac` that run
  a Checker Framework checker as an annotation processor (i.e., the arguments are NOT passed to the `javac` used while
  building the target project without running the analysis). This option is intended for Checker Framework options,
  such as `-AassumeSideEffectFree` or
  [others documented in the Checker Framework manual](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#checker-options), but you
  can also use it to pass standard `javac` options (e.g. [those documented by Oracle](
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html)).
